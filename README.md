# Active Potato

### Overview
Active Potato is an inspiration application for the everyday individual who can’t decide what to do, whether they leave their couch or remain on it. Using the application provides users with the ability to look up outdoor and indoor activities. Additionally, as they find activities they enjoy, the user may save it to their profile, comment on it, or rate their own experience. The interactive aspects of the app allow users to respond to each other’s comments and engage in dialogue with those who may share their same interests.

### Using the app
Every user that visits the site will first land at the default homepage. From here, the functionality available to the user is dependent on the user's status in the application. Without being logged into an application user, the user is still able to search activities, review details, and navigate to enxternal sources. The user also has access to register a new user. If the user decides to create a system user to login as, more functionality opens up to the user that includes managing a user's account, leaving comments on activies, replying to other's comments, creating an interests list of activities, and creating new activities. The application also has admin account types that allow the application's user base to be managed.

### Lessons Learned
During the development of Active Potato, each phase of Object-Oriented Modelling (OOM) process presented unique challenges.
During the Analysis phase of OOM, our brainstorming process produced a solid start for our database schema. 
The Design phase of our schema produced some challenges for selecting table names and relationships that were intuitive and easy to understand. 
The Analysis phase of the backend for our application produced select goals that were rooted in our application user stories. The user stories provided a structured approach for coordinating entity mapping, JUnit testing, DAO/DAOImpl, and then finally the controllers.
The Design/Implementation process of the backend focused on peer programming, task coordination, and tag-team backend – frontend integration. JUnit testing was paramount to ensure that the entities were correctly mapped and appropriate relational mapping. 
Communication was extremely important to not only articulate intent of the desired end product, mitigate GitHub merge conflicts, and task creep.
As a team, flexibility during the OOM process ensured that we were able to discuss challenges with integration, course correction for code that did not produce the desired results, and integrating additional application features that were not initially anticipated.
Overall, the development of Active Potato was a fun and challenging project that was dependent on Agile Software Development and incorporating Scrum. Our team was able to resolve all of our challenges with backend – front end integration through excellent inter-team communication, peer programming, and many times, walking away from the computer for a short period.
We are very proud of the end product, and amazed at what we were collectively able to produce in eight days.
